# Jenkins Pipeline for Java based application using Maven, SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm and Kubernetes


Here are the step-by-step details to set up an end-to-end Jenkins pipeline for a Java application using SonarQube, Jenkins, Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes:

Prerequisites:

   -  Java application code hosted on a Git repository
   -   Jenkins server
   -  Kubernetes cluster
   -  Helm package manager

Steps:

    1. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins:
       1.1 Git plugin
       1.2 Maven Integration plugin
       1.3 Pipeline plugin
       1.4 Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

    2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline:
       2.1 In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
       2.2 Add a Jenkinsfile to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

    3. Define the pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: Checkout the source code from Git.
        Stage 2: Build the Java application using Maven.
        Stage 3: Run unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.
        Stage 4: Run SonarQube analysis to check the code quality.
        Stage 5: Package the application into a JAR file.
        Stage 6: Deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
        Stage 7: Run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.

    4. Configure Jenkins pipeline stages:
        Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
        Stage 2: Use the Maven Integration plugin to build the Java application.
        Stage 3: Use the JUnit and Mockito plugins to run unit tests.
        Stage 4: Use the SonarQube plugin to analyze the code quality of the Java application.
        Stage 5: Use the Maven Integration plugin to package the application into a JAR file.
        Stage 6: Use the Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin to deploy the application to a test environment using Helm.
        Stage 7: Use a testing framework like Selenium to run user acceptance tests on the deployed application.


    7. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
       7.1 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Java application.
       7.2 Monitor the pipeline stages and fix any issues that arise.
